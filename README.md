# Project Overview

The Student Activity Tracker System is designed to provide a structured, database-based solution for managing student extracurricular activities. The system allows advisors to register activities and record student participation, while students can view available activities, application status, and their personal activity history.

The application is built using Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM and a SQLite database, following proper database normalization up to Third Normal Form (3NF).
